/// The type signature of a Forth function is:
///     Stack<Cell>->Stack<Cell>
/// We do not strickly need to return the stack as it is a class and
/// the higher-order function that composes our "Forth" `Word`s
/// can handle implicitly passing it along the chain. However, 
/// defining `Word` with the return value allows a user to define 
/// custom `Word`s with less boilerplate. Easy factoring is a major
/// plus to Forth's model and should be preserved where possible.
public typealias Word = Stack<Cell>->Stack<Cell>

/// This is the Word Composition Operator. It is our central
/// conceit and serves several purposes:
/// 1. We can push items onto the stack with it.
/// 2. We can apply `Word`s (explicit stack manipulation).
/// 3. We can apply unmodified functions whose arguments 
///    will be taken from the `Stack`. As you may imagine,
///    bad things happen if those arguments aren't correct.
///
/// Sadly, space is not avalible as our operator of word
/// composition.
